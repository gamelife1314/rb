# v0.1.1 - 2023-03-18

:wave::wave::wave:

`rsb` v0.1.0 is the first version, the main function of this tool is to realize the pressure test on the Http server. The development of this tool is mainly inspired by the [`bombardier`](https://github.com/codesenberg/bombardier) project, and I would like to thank the author for his contribution. On the other hand, this tool was developed primarily to learn and understand Rust.
